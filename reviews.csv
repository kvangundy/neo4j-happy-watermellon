4306,a wonderful satirical fable that cleverly subverts those wellknown fairy tales offering endless fun for kids and pure delight for adults with some astonishing visuals and acid humor while being extremely funny enchanting and surprisingly swee
4306,shrek is up there with the greatest animated films ever it is an animated film that was everything a comedy and animated film should be but i am serious never before has a movie spoofed fairy tales and princess stories so well and it actually has a great deal of heart to it that made it just so better as well mike myers eddie murphy and cameron diaz were incredible in voicing their roles and their characters are some of the most memorable and fun characters in animated film history shrek is hard to top in animatio because of how well they struck gold when making this masterpiece it isnt the greatest animated film ever but i swear on the name of god its one of the best
4306,shrek is a film that never disappointed me this humourous take on fairytales provides a great message to its audience and is by far the best out of a series that unfortunately will never end
2294,a weak attempt from woody allen and dreamworks to cash in on computer generated technology it is the ugly cousin of bugs life a far better film this is a bland script with cheesy dialogue and uninteresting characters
2294,woody allen i love that ending homage to allens beloved new york with doris day heading off the closing credits the animation is far worse than a bugs life but as a story i like antz better while i wouldnt say the movie is particularlly colorful in respect to bugs and their lives the dialogue is pure woody and because of that it is hilarious this is also probably the inception of disney hiring famous actors to do voicework but somehow  at least in this film  it doesnt detract
2294,when you would compare it to a bugs life you would be dissapointed how much dreamworks has copied from it while a bugs life is childish and funny antz uses excessive idiocy to make people laugh truth to be told it does not deserve 95 good actors have wasted their talents on this film
673,nostalgic sure a staple of our generation sure but a good film not exactly it is horrifyingly dated poorly written badly paced and at the end of the day rather pointless one must admit however that it was an ingenious commercial ploy michael jordan and the looney tunes? brilliant but this doesnt make it a quality cinematic experience the only takeaway from the film is that billy murray can make anything better and that i believe i can fly by r kelly is still as beautiful and iconic as ever its unfortunate such a powerful song is associated with this failure of a childrens film
673,i cant love this movie enough it is possibly one of the most underrated movies of all time brilliant visulas for the 90s an interesting story and tons of laughs one of the movies i want to watch again right after finishing it
673,space jam is one of those so bad its good movies its a decent basketball movie but the inclusion of looney tunes characters just feels tacked on and awkward space jam obviously shows that it is intended to be like the viewer is watching an episode of looney tunes but ends up being a mess of ideas the movie has been made a classic and the internet proves that this might be just me nitpicking but whenever i see space jamrelated videos coughmashupscough it bugs me that everyone praises charles barkley as the main protagonist when in actuality its michael jordan who is the protagonist i heard a sequel is in the works so hopefully the sequel will be better
